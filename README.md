# About this repository

This repository is Kenny Chiu's submission for the [participation](https://stat545.stat.ubc.ca/evaluation/participation/) component for [STAT 545](https://stat545.stat.ubc.ca) at the University of British Columbia. STAT 545 is a data wrangling course with the following (quoted) learning outcomes:

> * explore, groom, visualize, and analyze data
> * make all of that reproducible, reusable, and shareable
> * using R

The files in this repository are a mixture of notes and exercises that were done in class. Most exercises that were not completed in class are left undone.


# Navigation

Most participation exercises involve a `.Rmd` file and its corresponding output(s). We will only link to the specifically required files below. Other auxiliary files can be found in the class subfolder (also linked below).
